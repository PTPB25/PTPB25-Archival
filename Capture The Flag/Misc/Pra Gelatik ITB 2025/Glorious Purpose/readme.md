# Glorious Purpose
### Category: Misc, OSINT

**Description:**

> I've been reading a lot lately. Some of my recent favorites include How to Be Free, The Burnout Society, and Meditations.
>
> I enjoyed them so much that I found a social media account that shares insights from similar books. It caught my attention, and there's one video I really like—something about finding one's true purpose.
> Can you find what I'm looking for?
>
> Now, I'm thinking about what to read next—maybe Nicomachean Ethics.
